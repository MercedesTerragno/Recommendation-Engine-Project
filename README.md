## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

In this project we will analyze the interactions that users have with different articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform. 
We will study data available in that platform to build a recommendation engine that is able to show the articles that are most pertinent to each user.

The project is divided in the following sections:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Rank Based Recommendations
- User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
- Matrix Factorization
- Final recommendation system

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
- Data:
  - articles_community.csv: detailed information about each article in the platform.
  - user-item-interactions.csv: information about the interaction between users and articles in the platform.
- Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb: notebook showcasing the different sections and rationale of the project.
